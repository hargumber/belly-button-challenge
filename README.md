# belly-button-challenge
- The **objective** of this challenge was to build an interactive dashboard that will give the user freedom to explore the Biodiversity data. The data used in this assignment is from the 16s rRNA sequencing of the bacteria residing in the navels of people. This sequencing technique identifies which bacteria or Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) exist in a population. 

- The **files** added to the repo are:
-- index.html
-- samples.json - contains the data
-- app.js - contains the code

The **Visualizations** made are: 
-- A horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to let the user select the sample id.
-- A bubble chart to display the relative abundances of OTUs in a selected sample. 

The plots have been deployed to the GitHub pages.
